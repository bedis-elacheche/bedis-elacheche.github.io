I would like to thank every single person who answered questions on stackoverflow, people who wrote articles and created tutorials that made me discover many technologies and contributed in making me the person I am today.\n\nWriting few words on my website won't give enough recongnition to these people. That's why, I tried, on my turn to share this knowledge with people around me and helped, even a little bit, to make the tech community grow.\n\n## Trainer\n\n### Javascript essentials\n\n- Date: November 2017\n- Context:\n\n### Node.js essentials\n\n- Date: December 2016\n- Context:\n\n### SVN essentials\n\n- Date: October 2016\n- Context:\n\n### jQuery essentials\n\n- Date: December 2015\n- Context:\n\n### INSAT Android Club: Cross Platform Development\n\n- Date: June 2013 -> July 2014\n- Context:\n\n## Speaker\n\n### Tunisian WebDev Meetup\n\n- Date: April 2016\n- Context:\n\n### North American Tunisian Engineers Group (NATEG) Days\n\n- Date: August 2014\n- Context:\n\n### Africa Android Challenge Workshops\n\n- Date: May 2014\n- Context:\n"}}]);
